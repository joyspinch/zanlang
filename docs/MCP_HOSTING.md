# Hosting the Zan MCP server

The MCP server can host a workspace over stdio or HTTP. Knowledge files are
server-side artifacts: clients do not need local copies of `symbols.json`,
`gallery.json`, or `zform.json`.

Generate the source-driven gallery and form schema with the Zan tool:

```text
zanc tools/genknowledge/GenKnowledge.zan --stdlib-path stdlib -o build/genknowledge
build/genknowledge --root . --stdlib stdlib --out knowledge \
  --seed tools/mcp_server/gallery.json \
  --doc tools/mcp_server/zform.doc.json \
  --controls tools/mcp_server/zform.controls.txt --write-controls
```

After the server starts, `zan_start_here` reports whether the knowledge
artifacts are present and fresh. A mutable server with the source inputs
advertises `zan_refresh_knowledge`, which regenerates `gallery.json` and
`zform.json` in process. It does not build RepoMap or replace `symbols.json`;
generate that index separately when it is missing.

For a shared HTTP deployment, bind to a non-loopback address only with bearer
authentication:

```text
tools/zan-mcp.exe . --host 0.0.0.0 --token-env ZAN_MCP_TOKEN
```

Use `--read-only` for deployments that must not write workspace files.
`--frozen-tools` keeps the advertised catalog stable across workspaces; calls
to unavailable tools still return a diagnostic.
